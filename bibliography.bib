(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Describing a potential energy surface in terms of local minima and the transition states that connect them provides a conceptual and computational framework for understanding and predicting observable properties. Visualizing the potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs supplies a graphical connection between different structure-seeking systems, which can relax efficiently to a particular morphology. Landscapes involving competing morphologies support multiple potential energy funnels, which may exhibit characteristic heat capacity features and relaxation time scales. These connections between the organization of the potential energy landscape and structure, dynamics and thermodynamics are common to all the examples presented, ranging from atomic and molecular clusters to biomolecules and soft and condensed matter. Further connections between motifs in the energy landscape and the interparticle forces can be developed using symmetry considerations and results from catastrophe theory.},
