  abstract = {Describing a potential energy surface in terms of local minima and the transition states that connect them provides a conceptual and computational framework for understanding and predicting observable properties. Visualizing the potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs supplies a graphical connection between different structure-seeking systems, which can relax efficiently to a particular morphology. Landscapes involving competing morphologies support multiple potential energy funnels, which may exhibit characteristic heat capacity features and relaxation time scales. These connections between the organization of the potential energy landscape and structure, dynamics and thermodynamics are common to all the examples presented, ranging from atomic and molecular clusters to biomolecules and soft and condensed matter. Further connections between motifs in the energy landscape and the interparticle forces can be developed using symmetry considerations and results from catastrophe theory.},

  abstract = {Abstract A widely used way to compare the structures of biomolecules or solid bodies is to translate and rotate one structure with respect to the other to minimize the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). We present a simple derivation, based on quaternions, for the optimal solid body transformation (rotation-translation) that minimizes the RMSD between two sets of vectors. We prove that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known formula due to Kabsch. We analyze the various cases that may arise, and give a complete enumeration of the special cases in terms of the arrangement of the eigenvalues of a traceless, 4 × 4 symmetric matrix. A key result here is an expression for the gradient of the RMSD as a function of model parameters. This can be useful, for example, in finding the minimum energy path of a reaction using the elastic band methods or in optimizing model parameters to best fit a target structure. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
